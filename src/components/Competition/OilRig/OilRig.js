                         <p>As the production of crude oil and gas increases, crude reserves are decreasing and so is the production rate. Thus, inventions are made to meet the requirement of the demanding world. Inventions, either in the way of production or even the source of hydrocarbons, are made to adapt to the field condition which are pretty much challenging. We have to think innovatively and economically to build an offshore oil rig to adapt. In order to sustain the economical value of the operating oil rig, offshore oil rig must be able to cope with the hard condition such as high CO2, H2S content, and the depth of the sea.</p>
                         <p>Participants need to gather ideas to design the best semi-submersible oil rig design without neglecting economic issue for the well known Macondo Prospect (MC252)  Field in Gulf of Mexico that blew up and was documented in the <i>“Deepwater Horizon”</i> Film.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional Notes : </strong>The assessment for favorite oil rig model competition will be based on the direct voting for each oil rig model when it is being exhibited in the IPCONVEX 2019 at February 16th, 2019. If the votes’ number is still inadequate, there will be additional mechanism to assess the rig which is by using likes for instagram. The models will be posted on IPFEST 2019’s official instagram account at the comptition day and the likes from the post will be used to further assess the rig model.</p>

In this session, the assessment will be obtained from the weight ratio of the mockup with the maximum load that is able to be carried by the mock-up.

The mockups will be placed on the water then the loads will be given on deck continuously. Both the Buoyancy test and Load test, the committee will serve loads for the participants. Load test will stop if there are conditions such as the bottom of the deck touch the water surface, the deck is damaged, the mock-up is over tuned, and the mock-up sinks. In this session, the assessment will be obtained from the weight ratio of the mockup with the maximum load that is able to be carried by the mock-up.

                            IPFEST 2019 Oil Rig Design Competition is a competition which combines the petroleum industry knowledge, engineering principal, and design concept to create a model of oil rigs. Participants hopefully can make a new innovative and creative design to create miniature of semi-submersible oil rig to achieve future energy demand satisfaction. Participants create a miniature of semi-submersible oil rig which similar to real semi-submersible oil rig by considering several fundamental factors, such as model effectiveness, stability and safety, and budget plan.
